# RestoRewind

### "Where do you want to eat?" "I don't know, where do *you* want to eat?"

Foodies and non-foodies alike know the annoyance of trying to decide on a restaurant, and coming up with no ideas. Scrolling through endless restaurant options on Google and delivery apps can be overwhelming and time-consuming. Wouldn’t it be great if you could instead browse through your own collection of restaurants to be reminded of where you’ve been and what you liked?

This app will allow the user to keep track of and add new restaurants they’ve visited, saving:
- the restaurant's name
- cuisine type
- a personal rating
- extra notes (eg. the price point or a favourite dish)

Users will be able to view their collection of restaurants and filter by rating or cuisine type in order to help make decisions on where to eat!
